Welcome!

During this courses, we will learn file and folder tree and run some bash commands.

The left panel will contain the explanations and guides to run command lines. Use the right panel to type the command examples, and try as many experiments as you want.

During the course, some bash language commands will be explained. They will be written in **bold** and must be copied identically in the right window (or clic on the small arrow at the end of the command line). Their parameters will be written in _italics_. Their text or value can be modified if you wish, but you will have to remember the changes afterwards. We therefore advise you to keep the text or value proposed in the example.
