## Computer interfaces

Instructing a computer to perform a particular task can be done through two ways. The graphical user interface (GUI) controlled through a mouse or using keyboard shortcuts has been popularized since the advent of the operating systems for personal computers. Command line interface (CLI) is an alternative solution which allows users to send computer instructions using a dedicated language.
