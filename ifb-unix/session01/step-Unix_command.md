With a bash shell, you write and execute Linux commands. A Linux command is made of an instruction, options and arguments.

The space character is mandatory to separate all these elements. You may now understand why a space in a file or a directory name is a very bad idea in a Linux environment.

Be very careful with the case while writing your Linux commands, lowercases and uppercase are not the same! Linux commands are usually in lowercase though.
