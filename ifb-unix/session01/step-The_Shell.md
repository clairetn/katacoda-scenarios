The Shell is a software that can handle multiple Linux instructions and has become mandatory in the bioinformatics field. 
Indeed, the multiple steps of a bioinformatics analysis usually need to be stored for traceability, reproducibility or automation purposes. With a shell, you can perform highly complex tasks including accessing locally or distantly shared resources (e.g. files, databases, remote computing clusters...).

To access these powerful features, you need to learn a new way of thinking and a new language.
