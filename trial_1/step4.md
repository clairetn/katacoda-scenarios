##Â Note 

During the course, some bash language commands will be explained. They will be written in **bold** and must be copied identically in the right window. Their parameters will be written in _italics_. Their text or value can be modified if you wish, but you will have to remember the changes afterwards. We therefore advise you to keep the text or value proposed in the example.

## File

In computer information are stored into files. 
To see present files, run the command **ls** (list):

`ls`{{execute}}

Currently, there is no file (the **ls** command reply nothing). 

With the command **touch** we will create 2 empty files named _test1.txt_ and _test2.txt_ :

`touch test1.txt test2.txt`{{execute}}

Now, the **ls** command lists the 2 new files:

`ls`{{execute}}
