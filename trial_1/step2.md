##Â Folder creation

Men often prefer to store files in directories. 
With the **mkdir** (make file) command we create a folder named _class1_:

`mkdir class1`{{execute}}

This command reply nothing but it create a folder. To see this folder, we use the command that list files we saw in previous step, **ls**:

`ls`{{execute}}

## Move file to folder

We now move the _text1.txt_ file into the _class1_ folder with the **mv** (move) command:

`mv text1.txt class1/`{{execute}}

To see the result, run one again the **ls** command:

`ls`{{execute}}

The _text1.txt_ file seems to have disappear but it is in fact in the _class1_ folder.
