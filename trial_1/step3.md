Step3: Move in file tree

##Â Task

To find the file _text1.txt_, we are going to move in the directory _class1_ with the command **cd** (change directory):

`cd class1`{{execute}}

We moved our point of view into the _class1_ directory and the **ls** command now gives the list of files present in this _class1_ directory

`ls`{{execute}}
